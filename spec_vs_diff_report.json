  "summary": "The diff shows deployment-related changes including a manifest.json addition, updates to frontend routes, components, and backend logic. However, the diff appears to be a continuation of feature development rather than a deployment-only change. Key deployment artifacts like dfx.json configuration, canister deployment scripts, or IC-specific deployment configuration are not present in the diff. Several features mentioned in REQ-25 (social sharing buttons, Founding 50 Hosts landing page, PWA install button, service worker) are not evidenced in the diff.",
