# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deploy the StaySpread application to the Internet Computer network.

**Planned changes:**
- Configure and deploy the frontend canister to serve the React application on the Internet Computer
- Configure and deploy the backend canister so all API calls from the frontend resolve correctly
- Ensure all existing routes (host dashboard, promoter dashboard, listings, Stripe Checkout, Internet Identity auth, PWA, Founding 50 Hosts page, social sharing) are accessible at the deployed URL

**User-visible outcome:** The fully deployed StaySpread application is live on the Internet Computer and accessible via a public URL, with all existing features functioning as before.
